## Code Example

**Find The Parity Outlier from CODEWARS**: You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

```
function findOutlier(integers){

  let evenNumber = integers.filter(elem => elem % 2 == 0);
  let oddNumber = integers.filter(elem => elem % 2 != 0);

  if (evenNumber.length === 1) {
    return evenNumber[0];
  } else if (oddNumber.length === 1) {
    return oddNumber[0];
  }

}
```
